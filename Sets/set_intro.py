set = {1,3,10,9,1}
print(set) # it prints 1,10,3,9


#print(set[0]) # it will ceate error , set is not indexing

# Set itself is mutable object but we cannot store mutable object in a set
# string,boolean, integer, float are immuatable
# list -is mutable
# in set you cannot store list 

# set1 = {1,9,3,4,[3,456,6,7]} # it sill give error
